To make it work with laravel, pull the following package from your laravel poject directory:

(ssh to your server and run php artisan queue:work or listen ) next we check supervisor to keep listening

Supervisor:
----------
sudo apt-get install supervisor
Y (prompt)
cd /etc/supervisor/conf.d (supervisor loads all the the configurations files container in this directory)
(add one for our queues now)
sudo vi queue.conf

[program:queue]
command=php artisan queue:listen --tries=2
directory=/home/vagrant/Code/genesis-address-book 
stdout_logfile=/home/vagrant/Code/genesis-address-book/storage/logs/supervisor.log

(directory is the project root in order artisan to be recognized)

sudo supervisorctl
